The Quotes Application is an application that enables the user to create a Quote with inputs for the type, the quote, the author, the day it was created and the person submitting the quote alongside a display for the quotes created with already existing quotes. More so, the user can also decide to Upvote or Downvote the existing quotes and the Quote with the highest Vote is displayed.
